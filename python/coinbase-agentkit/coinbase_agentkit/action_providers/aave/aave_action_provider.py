This tool allows repaying borrowed assets to Aave V3 protocol.
It takes:
- asset_id: The asset to repay, one of `weth`, `usdc`, `cbeth`, `wstETH`, `cbBTC`, or `GHO`
- amount: The amount of tokens to repay in human-readable format or 'max' to repay all
    Examples:
    - 1 WETH
    - 0.1 WETH
    - 100 USDC
    - max
- interest_rate_mode: (Optional) Interest rate mode: 1 for stable, 2 for variable. Default is variable (2).
- on_behalf_of: (Optional) The address to repay debt for, defaults to wallet address

Important notes:
- Make sure to have the required tokens in your wallet
- Repaying will increase your health factor, reducing liquidation risk
- You must specify the correct interest rate mode for the debt you're repaying
